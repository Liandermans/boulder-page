      <h2>What is bouldering?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Bouldering</strong> is a form of rock climbing that focuses on
        shorter routes, typically called <em>problems</em>, which are usually no
        more than a few meters high. <br />
        Unlike traditional rock climbing, bouldering is performed without the
        use of ropes or harnesses. Instead, climbers rely on padded mats, known
        as
        <em>crash pads</em>, to protect them in case of falls.

        <h3><span class="exclamation-mark">!</span> Safety notice:</h3>
        <p>
          While bouldering is generally considered safer than traditional rock
          climbing due to the shorter heights involved, safety precautions are
          still essential. Proper warm-up exercises, learning how to fall
          safely, and using crash pads are of vital importance.
